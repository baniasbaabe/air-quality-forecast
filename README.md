## Motivation & Goal

There are two main drivers for this project:

1. Stuttgart is well-known for its high density of traffic, and its high level of air pollution in Germany. Multiple fine dust alarms aren't calming. Even if there are ways to combat this problem, it's still worrying.

2. A more technological motivation: I wanted to build an end-to-end Machine Learning project with free tools only. You will see thousands of MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) articles where they will develop projects with tools like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Airflow, etc... But I also noticed that you will usually have to spend money in some way because the tools (or the deployment of those tools) aren't free (or only free for a limited period). So, the challenge here is to leverage only free tools (or tools with a generous free tier) to build a cool project.

## Data

## Architecture

I used a [3-Pipeline-Architecture](https://www.serverless-ml.org/blog/what-is-serverless-machine-learning), consisting of a Feature Pipeline, Training Pipeline, and Batch Inference Pipeline.
